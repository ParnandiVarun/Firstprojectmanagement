# How to Use This Board to Track Project Progress:

To Do: This column contains all tasks that need to be completed for the project. When you begin a project, you start by listing all the key deliverables or tasks that need to be done. In the example above, tasks like designing the UI, developing the backend API, and preparing a marketing strategy are planned out but have not yet started.

In Progress: As you begin working on each task, you move them from the "To Do" column to "In Progress." This is an active phase where team members focus on completing the tasks. For example, if a developer begins working on the backend API, they would move that task to "In Progress."

Done: Once a task is fully completed, it moves to the "Done" column. This signifies that the task is finished and no further action is required. This column helps track what has been accomplished and provides visibility into the overall progress.

Plan for Tracking Progress:
Weekly Review: At the end of each week, review the tasks in the "To Do" column to ensure they are still relevant and align with the project’s goals. Move tasks that have started to "In Progress."
Daily Updates: Team members should update the board daily or as often as they complete tasks. This ensures the board reflects the current state of the project.
Completion Tracking: The "Done" column serves as a visual progress tracker. Seeing tasks move from "To Do" to "Done" provides a clear view of project completion, helping identify if the team is on schedule.
This visual approach will make it easier to manage tasks, identify bottlenecks, and ensure that everyone on the team understands the current status of the project.

# Reflection on Project Management Tools:

Using GitHub's project management features, such as milestones, issues, and project boards, can significantly enhance team collaboration and project organization. Milestones allow teams to set clear goals with deadlines, ensuring everyone is aligned and working towards the same objective. This helps in prioritizing tasks and tracking progress, which is vital for staying on schedule. Issues provide a structured way to identify, document, and resolve specific tasks or bugs. They can be tagged, assigned to team members, and tracked for resolution, ensuring that all necessary tasks are accounted for and completed. Project boards, often organized in Kanban style, visually represent the status of tasks and provide a clear overview of the project’s workflow. By moving tasks through stages like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done," project boards foster transparency and accountability.

These tools encourage communication by allowing team members to comment on issues and share updates, making collaboration more streamlined. They also help with accountability by assigning ownership to specific tasks, ensuring that no item is overlooked.

However, some challenges could arise during implementation. For example, some team members may initially struggle to adopt these tools, especially if they are unfamiliar with GitHub or similar systems. It might also be difficult to maintain discipline in regularly updating issues and project boards, leading to confusion or missed deadlines. Additionally, larger projects may require more complex workflows, which could overwhelm the team if not structured properly from the beginning. Overcoming these challenges will require proper training and clear guidelines on usage
